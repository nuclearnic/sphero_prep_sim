## Prep Activity: Learn to Control Sphero Programmatically

---

We're going to be playing with a <b>Sphero</b> robot on Make Day! The two activities in this repo are intended to give you some familiarity with Sphero's Javascript SDK. Since you probably don't have a Sphero at home, we'll use a mock library that will give you the basic idea.

If you want explore the SDK itself then have a look here: https://github.com/orbotix/sphero.js

<b>Cheat Sheet.</b> Below are the commands you'll be learning about:

* `sphero.connect`: Connects to Sphero. All you're code goes inside this function.

* `sphero.roll`: Takes two arguments - distance (unitless) and direction (in degrees). The direction you 0Â° relative to the x-axis - see the image below:

![alt clockwise_rotation](./assets/Counterclockwise_rotation.png)

* `sphero.setColor`: Takes a string with the color as argument. In lower-case, e.g. "blue", "red", "green", etc.

* `sphero.getColor`: Returns Sphero's current color.

* `sphero.readOdometer`: We've cheated a little here! In the Sphero SDK the Odometer streams data asynchronously when invoking `streamOdometer`, while here we're just returning Sphero's position. We've included this function so you can get a little familiar with the concept.

<b>TIP:</b> See `example.js` for all of the commands required to finish the two activities.

<!-- ### Installing Node JS

There's nothing fancy going on here, so you only need `node` to run these examples. If you don't have node installed, then have a look below. If your OS is not included, then detailed instructions are available [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions). If you have any issues with the installation then reach out to us on Slack and we'll assist :).

On Debian based <b>Linux</b> distros run the following commands in your terminal:
```console
$ curl --silent --location https://deb.nodesource.com/node_6.x | sudo bash -
$ sudo apt-get install --yes nodejs
```

On <b>Mac</b> just run the following in your terminal:
```console
brew install node
```

On <b>Windows</b> simply download the [Windows Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/#download) directly from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) web site. -->

### Activity #1

<i> Change Sphero's color and move him programmatically. </i>

* Open activity_1.js and add the required code so that Sphero's final position is at <b>(0, 200)</b> and it's color is <b>"Blue"</b>.

### Activity #2 (Optional)

<i> Sphero's initial position is randomized: Find Sphero's coordinates with the Odomoter and move him to <b>(0, 0)</b>. Send Sphero home! </i>

* Open `activity_2.js` and find Sphero's initial position.
* You have to send Sphero back to <b>(0, 0)</b>, so use the Odometer's reading and figure out a way to do that!
